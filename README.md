## How it works

DatePlanner uses PlayWright MCP to control your browser to make reservations and purchase tickets. It aggregates the latest
content from websites like Resy, OpenTable, Eater, TimeOut, etc. to determine the hottest new restaurants in your area.
It also aggregates content from Instagram creators to find the most hyped events happening near you. With your permission,
DatePlanner will make reservations and purchase tickets on your behalf and add a detailed itinerary for each weekend to your
Google/iCloud calendar.
